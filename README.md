# Object-Detection-System
This project is an Object Detection system using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module with a pre-trained SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) MobileNet model. The system detects and identifies objects in a video file, highlighting each detected object with a bounding box and label.
